            <h2>Sherry Wang</h2>
                <p class="subheader">President</p>
                    <p class="normal-text">
                        <img src="../img/sherry.jpg" alt="Sherry">
                        Sherry is the current President of VEIn and a senior biology major in Arts and Sciences. She has always been interested in the history of vaccination and quickly became concerned about the growing anti-vaccine movement. When VEIn first starting out she joined the eBoard as Graphic Design Chair, and now hopes to help other students realize the benefits of vaccination and the resources they have access to as part of the Cornell community.</p>
            <h2>Kelsey Fryer</h2>
                <p class="subheader">Vice President</p>
                    <p class="normal-text">
                        <img src="../img/kelsey.jpg" alt="Kelsey">
                        Kelsey is currently a junior biology major in CALS. Her parents chose to vaccinate her as a child and there wasn't much to debate about at home in terms of vaccines. When she got to college, she was shocked at how many people had misconceptions about vaccines. Kelsey hadn't set out to argue for vaccines, but she often found myself doing it. The problem was, she would often find myself unable to back up her claims with evidence. Kelsey joined the vaccine education initiative not only to learn about vaccine, but to learn how to argue for vaccines. With the decreasing vaccination rates, she has realized the importance of our mission and hopes to continue to help educate the Cornell and Ithaca communities about the facts about vaccines.</p>
            <h2>Aaron Waybright</h2>
                <p class="subheader">Treasurer</p>
                    <p class="normal-text">
                        <img src="../img/aaron.jpg" alt="Aaron">
                        Aaron Waybright is a junior majoring in Plant Science through CALS and the treasurer for the Vaccine Education Initiative. Aaron became interested in vaccines after reading a book about the Salk and Sabine polio vaccines. He hopes VEIn can further educate our surrounding community on the important realities about vaccines. </p>
            <h2>Cindy Zou</h2>
                <p class="subheader">Secretary</p>
                    <p class="normal-text">
                        <img src="../img/cindy.jpg" alt="Cindy">
                        Cindy was born in Saskatchewan, Canada, but moved to Miami, Florida when she was 7 years old. She is currently a freshman at Cornell University studying plant sciences, but she has an interest in medicine as well. In high school, Cindy dedicated some time to volunteering in local hospitals, such as the Mount Sinai Medical Center and Miami Childrenâ€™s Hospital, which was where her interest in medicine began. As part of the Vaccine Education Initiative (VEin) at Cornell, she hopes to be able to contribute towards educating others on the benefits of vaccination and further her own education in medicine.</p>
